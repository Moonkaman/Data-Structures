    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?

    I would think they would be about the same. I don't know exactly how array.splice works under the hood but based on this https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lets-clear-up-the-confusion-around-the-slice-splice-split-methods-in-javascript-8ba3266c29ae

    it looks like it just removes the element at the index you give it n amount of times. The delete method on the doubly linked list doesn't have a way to delete things multiple times in one call but it does the same thing essentially, take the node you give it and remove it. I suppose in worst case scenario for array.splice you could keep getting rid of things until that index wasn't there anymore in which case that would be O(n).
